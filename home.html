        <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
        <p>This refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among other effects, that occur over several decades or longer.</p>
        <h2>GLOBAL WARMING</h2>
        <p>This refers to the recent and ongoing rise in global average temperature near Earth's surface. It is caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Global warming is causing climate patterns to change. However, global warming itself represents only one aspect of climate change.</p>

    </section>
    <p>Climate change is majorly caused by Global warming. This co-relation helps in the understanding and eradication of its effects.</p>

    <p>Inorder to achieve the this goal we have to take sigtnificant steps by getting to know its causes,effects and how to combat climate change for a sustainable future.</p>
